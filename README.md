# Project Data Structures

During the Data Structures and Algorithms course at university, I encountered several important data structures. For five of these, I was assigned projects to implement abstract data types and subsequently test them to ensure the quality of the project. These assignments allowed me to delve deeper into the fundamentals and supported my ongoing effort to broaden my horizons. Here are the 5 projects:
- **[ADT Sorted Bag on Dynamic Array with relation](https://github.com/Eduardismund/Project-Data-Structures/tree/main/DynamicArray_SortedBag)**
  
- **[ADT Bag on SLL with (element, frequency) pairs](https://github.com/Eduardismund/Project-Data-Structures/tree/main/SLL_Bag)**


- **[ADT Sorted Set on DLLA with relation](https://github.com/Eduardismund/Project-Data-Structures/tree/main/DLLA_SortedSet)**
  

- **[ADT Set on Hashtable with open addressing and double hashing](https://github.com/Eduardismund/Project-Data-Structures/tree/main/Hashtable_Set)**


- **[ADT Matrix, where elements (triplets <line, column, value>) are stored in a BST with linked representation and dynamic allocation](https://github.com/Eduardismund/Project-Data-Structures/tree/main/BST_Matrix)**
